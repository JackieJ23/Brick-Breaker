brief  Read me file for Brick Breaker Game

Brick Breaker Introduction:
Brick breaker is a game where the player controls a horitzontal bar moving left and
right trying to keep a ball from hitting the bottom of the screen. To progress
throughout the game, the player must bounce the ball off the bar to break bricks
in the top half of the screen. When all the bricks are cleared, new bricks are
generated and the speed of the ball increases thus increasing the difficutly of the
game.

When the program starts, the player is presented a message displaying the game name.
When the navigation switch is pushed down, the game starts and the player can
control the bar by pushing the navigation switch to the left and right.
Once the game ends, when the ball hits the bottom of the screen, a game over message
is displayed. The navigation switch can be pressed down again to get back to the
start screen.

Controls:
Navigation switch down         - Start game/Navigate menus.
Navigaiton switch left (West)  - Move bar left.
Navigation switch right (East) - Move bar right.
